TO-DOs:
   - if implementation in actual neural network is desired, a control module is needed to communicate with
      the layers of the network and which handles the timing of inputs and outputs correctly
      
   - further verification of the module with a bigger test and control vector (Matlab can be used to verify
      correct computation of the output value by the Verilog module)
